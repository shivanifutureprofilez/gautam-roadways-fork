            Our approach has not changed in three generations: a confirmed booking is a commitment. Trucks roll on schedule, bilty is issued at pickup, branch hand-offs are recorded, and the complaint desk is reachable on a single number. Everything else — capacity, technology, fleet size — is downstream of that.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
            This is why our customer base is dominated by repeat consignors who have moved freight with us for decades, not by single-shipment bookings.

            A legacy built across three generations.
          </h2>

          <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
            Gautam Roadways was founded in 1959 by Om Prakash Bagga with a vision of
            providing reliable and trustworthy transportation services. What began as a
            commitment to dependable freight movement soon earned the trust of businesses
            across the region.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
            In 1977, the business was strengthened by the leadership of his elder son,
            Chander Pal Bagga, who expanded operations and developed long-term customer
            relationships that continue to define the company today.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
            In 2000, Puneet Bagga joined the organization, carrying forward the family
            legacy with a focus on modern logistics solutions, customer satisfaction and
            operational excellence.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
            Today, Gautam Roadways proudly stands as a third-generation family business,
            delivering trusted, dependable and quality transport services backed by over
            six decades of experience.
